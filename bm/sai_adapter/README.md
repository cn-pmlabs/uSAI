# SAI API
The sai lib (C lib) uses P4 thrift to configure the soft switch as described below:
<img src="../p4-sai/docs/SAI_arch.PNG" width="380">
## Including the SAI lib
The sai_api lib is currently under development.
In the meantime, please include sai.h, check the [unit test](test/unittest) folder for example.
Please build it from the src folder using "make".

## PTF tests
SAI Tests were written using the [ptf](https://github.com/p4lang/ptf) framework. 
The directory is divided to tests (ready and passing tests), wip_tests for work in progress.

### Runing the tests
First, run make from this location. This will build the sai library, generate the needed thrift and ctypesgen files, and will build the C thrift server, needed to run the tests. \\
ctypesgen will be needed  for this (python wrapper for the C header files used by ptf), and can be easily installed with pip:  
```shell
pip install ctypesgen
```  
or from source: [ctypesgen](https://github.com/davidjamesca/ctypesgen).

Now, follow these steps to run the PTF tests:  
1. In SAI-P4-BM/tree/master/p4-softswitch/targets/P4-SAI/ run:  
    1. veth_setup.sh  - to configure virtual ports. 
    2. run_server.sh  - to start the P4 BM server.  

2. Start new terminal and run the sai thrift server:  
    SAI-P4-BM/sai_adapter/test/sai_thrift_server/run_server.sh

3. Start another new terminal and run the [PTF tests](test/ptf_tests/) directly, or by one the test shell scripts found in the ptf test folder:  tests/ptf_tests/run_ptf.sh

### LOGS
During the tests, the following logs are outputted:
1) BM server log can be found under SAI-P4-BM/p4-softswitch/targets/P4-SAI/log.txt
2) thrift server log is outputted to SAI-P4-BM/sai_adapter/test/sai_thrift_server/logs/log.txt
3) PTF log is stdout.  

# SAI BM Contribution Guide
## Adding BM functionaity
For new Soft Switch features ("HW" flows), please follow the [SAI-P4-BM/p4-softswitch](../SAI-P4-BM/p4-softswitch/) readme.
### Python development server
For P4 new features testing, it is possible to bypass implementing new SAI C implementations, and just update the thirft implementation in python.
use the [python thrift server](test/sai_thrift_development_python_server/) found in test/sai_thrift_development_python_server/.
If you decide to do so, run the sai p4 thrift server with:
tests/sai_thrift_development_python_server/sai_rpc_server.sh

## Implementing new SAI functionaity:
* in [sai_adapter_interface.h](inc/sai_adapter_interface.h) create C function decleration. 
* in [sai_adapter_interface.cpp](src/sai_adapter_interface.cpp) create the function link, with the sai_object pointer.
* in [sai_adapter.h](inc/sai_adapter.h) add a static decleration for the function.
* for new/unimplemented api, also add the sai_api decleration, and link in the sai_api_query in the sai_object.h, and sai.c files.
* Add the function implementation to a .cpp file in the [src/](src/) dir, under the sai_object namespace.
* For PTF testing:
    * add thrift function implementation to the [sai_thrift_server](test/sai_thrift_server).
    * add PTF test in [test/ptf_tests/](test/ptf_tests/).
### Additional information
* the sai_object uses the [switch_meta_data.h](inc/switch_meta_data.h) to manage the runtime information regarding the sai_object_ids etc... 
* to configure the BM tables, use the P4 thrift API is found (after p4-sofswitch compliation) in /SAI-P4-BM/p4-softswitch/thrift_src/gen-cpp/bm/Standard.h
