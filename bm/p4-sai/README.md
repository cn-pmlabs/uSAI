# P4 SOFT SWITCH MODEL
This repository contains P4 implementation of SAI behavioural model, forked from [p4lang/behavioural_model](https://github.com/p4lang/behavioral-model/).
<a name="p4"></a>

The Model is meant to provide a conformal behavioural SAI(https://github.com/opencomputeproject/SAI) model.
It implements SAI 1.0 on top of soft switch coded via P4.  

## Compiling P4 Behavioural model 
For list of dependencies and build instructions:
[p4lang/behavioural_model](https://github.com/p4lang/behavioral-model/).
  
### Compiling P4 target
Due to current behavioral-model implemntation, targets can only be complied in the bm/behavioral-model/targets/ dir.
  First time/every target (cpp) change, use:  
    `bm/build_target.sh`
      
### Create virtual interfaces
To create the virtual interfaces and hosts. ```veth_setup.sh``` and remove them by ```veth_teardown.sh```
  
### Compiling P4 code
If any editing to the P4 program was made, before running it you first need to transform the P4 code into a json representation which can be consumed by the software switch. This
representation will tell bmv2 which tables to initialize, how to configure the
parser, ... It is produced by the [p4c-bm](https://github.com/p4lang/p4c-bm)
tool. Please take a look at the
[README](https://github.com/p4lang/p4c-bm/blob/master/README.rst) for this repo
to find out how to install it. Once this is done, 
use the script that is found inside the P4-SAI target directory as follows:

    ./compile_json.sh
      
### Running P4 program
running the switch can be done with the following command: ```run_server.sh``` found in P4-SAI target directory.
This script also implements some default configurations found in: p4src/DefaultConfig.txt
